# RobotApp
A Robot application that works with the Parallax WiFi module and an ActivityBot.

To use this you must enable SLIP on your Parallax WiFi module. You do this by opening the
module configuration page with your browser and then checking the "Enable SLIP on serial port"
box on the REST/MQTT configuration page.
